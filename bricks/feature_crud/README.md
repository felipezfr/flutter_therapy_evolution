# Feature CRUD Brick

[![Powered by Mason](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftinyurl.com%2Fmason-badge)](https://github.com/felangel/mason)

A Mason brick that generates a complete CRUD feature following the Clean Architecture pattern for the Flutter Therapy Evolution project.

## Overview 🏗️

This brick generates a feature with a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implementation following the project's architecture:

```
feature_name/
├── data/                # Data layer
│   └── repositories/    # Repository implementations
│
├── domain/              # Domain layer
│   └── entities/        # Domain entity classes
│
├── presentation/        # Presentation layer
│   ├── pages/           # UI screens
│   └── viewmodels/      # ViewModels with Command pattern
│
└── feature_name_module.dart  # Module for routing and DI
```

## Usage 🚀

### Via the Mason CLI

```bash
mason make feature_crud --name feature_name
```

### Parameters

- `name`: The name of the feature to generate (e.g., patient, consultation)

## Architecture 🏛️

The generated feature follows the project's Clean Architecture pattern:

1. **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic and rules
   - Entities: Core business objects
   - Repositories: Interfaces defining data operations

2. **Data Layer**: Implements the data access
   - Repositories: Concrete implementations of domain repositories
   - Models: Data transfer objects (can be extended)

3. **Presentation Layer**: UI components
   - Pages: UI screens for listing, creating, updating, and deleting entities
   - ViewModels: Command-based controllers for the UI

## Command Pattern

The feature uses the project's Command pattern implementation for handling async operations:
- Commands for loading data
- Commands for saving/updating entities
- Commands for deleting entities

## Integration with Flutter Modular

Each feature includes a module file that:
- Declares routes
- Provides dependency injection
- Configures the feature's binding

## Generated Files

- Entity class with base properties
- Repository interface and implementation
- List, detail, create and update pages
- ViewModels with appropriate commands
